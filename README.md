Google Maps Store Locator
======================

I created this as a widget to be put into a bigger site, it is very easy to implement and uses the Google Maps Javascript API v3. To use this you need an API key, you can get the info on how to do that https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key. It loads a JSON file containing the store name, address, latitude and longitude through ajax. It is responsive, and draws the map so that it fits all of the map markers on the map no matter how far apart they are. For this example I populated the map with some BBQ places in Brooklyn.
